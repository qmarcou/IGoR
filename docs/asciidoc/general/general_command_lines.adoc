|=======================================================================
|Command line argument |Description
|`-h` or `-help` |Displays IGoR's manual. Alternatively one could use
`man igor`.

|`-v` or `-version` |Displays IGoR's installed version number.

|`-set_wd /path/to/dir/` |Sets the working directory to _/path/to/dir/_,
default is _/tmp_. ** This should be an already existing directory and
will not be created by IGoR **

|`-threads N` |Sets the number of OpenMP threads to _N_ for alignments
and inference/evaluation. By default IGoR will use the maximum number of
threads.

|`-stdout_f /path/to/file` |Redirects the standard output to the file
_/path/to/file_

|`-read_seqs /path/to/file` |Reads the input sequences file
_/path/to/file_ and reformat it in the working directory. *This step is
necessary for running any action on sequences using the command line*.
Can be a fasta file, a csv file (with the sequence index as first column
and the sequence in the second separated by a semicolon ';') or a text
file with one sequence per line (format recognition is based on the file
extension). Providing this file will create a semicolon separated file
with indexed sequences in the _align_ folder.

|`-batch batchname` |Sets the batch name. This name will be used as a
prefix to alignment/indexed sequences files, output, infer, evaluate and
generate folders.

|`-chain chainname` |Selects a model and a set of genomic template
according to the value. Possible values for `chainname` are: `alpha`,
`beta`, `light`, `heavy_naive`, and `heavy_memory`. *This needs to be
set in order to use provided genomic templates/model*

|`-species speciesname` |Selects a species from the set of predefined
species. Possible values are: `human`.*This needs to be set in order to
use provided genomic templates/model*

|`-set_genomic --*gene* /path/to/file.fasta` |Set a set of custom
genomic templates for gene _gene_ (possible values are --V,--D and --J)
with a list of genomic templates contained in the file
_/path/to/file.fasta_ in fasta format. If the set of provided genomic
templates is already fully contained (same name and same sequence) in
the loaded model (default, custom, last_inferred), the missing ones will
be set to zero probability keeping the ratios of the others. For
instance providing only one already known genomic template will result
in a model with the considered gene usage to be 1.0, all others set to
0.0. *When using this option and introducing new/modified genomic
templates, the user will need to re-infer a model since the genomic
templates will no longer correspond to the ones contained in the
reference models, the model parameters are thus automatically reset to a
uniform distribution.*

|`-set_CDR3_anchors --*gene*` |Load a CSV file containing the indices/offset of
the CDR3 anchors for the _gene_(--V or --J). The index should correspond
to the first letter of the cysteine (for V) or tryptophan/phenylalanin
(for J) for the nucleotide sequence of the gene. Indices are 0 based.

|`-set_custom_model /path/to/model_parms.txt /path/to/model_marginals.txt`
|Use a custom model as a baseline for inference or evaluation. *Note
that this will override custom genomic templates for inference and
evaluation*. Alternatively, providing only the model parameters file
will lead IGoR to create model marginals initialized to a uniform
distribution.

|`-load_last_inferred` |Using this command will load the last inferred
model (folder _inference/final_xx.txt_) as a basis for a new inference,
evaluation or generation of synthetic sequences

|`-run_demo` |Runs the demo code on 300 sequences of 60bp TCRs (mostly a
sanity run check)

|`-run_custom` |Runs the code inside the custom section of the main.cpp
file

|`-subsample N` |Perform actions on a random subsample of _N_ sequences.
*This flag will have different effects depending on the supplied
commands:* if the `-read_seqs` command is used, the resulting indexed
sequence file will be a subsample of sequences contained in the original
file. Else, if the `-align` command is used the alignments will be
performed on a subsample of the indexed sequences. Else, if the
`-evaluate` or `-infer` command is used the inference will be run on a
subsample of the indexed sequences. _Obviously N should be < to the
total number of sequences available. The `-subsample` flag should be
used in only one command of a pipeline, see the Command example section
for details._
