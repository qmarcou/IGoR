Although a few command line options are supplied for basic use of IGoR,
its full modularity can be used through high level C++ functions on
which all previous command lines are built. A section of the main.cpp
file is dedicated to accept user supplied code and can be executed using
the `-run_custom` command line argument when launching IGoR from the
shell. An example of the high level workflow is given in the _run demo_
section and the full Doxygen generated documentation is available as
PDF. For any question please contact us.

Good practice would be to append the C++ code in the main in the scope
where "//Write your custom procedure here" is written. This part of the
code is reachable using the `-run_custom` command line argument. This is
done so that even after appending some custom code the command line
interface is still usable.
