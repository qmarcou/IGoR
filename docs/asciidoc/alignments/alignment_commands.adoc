Alignment commands summary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Alignment of the sequences is performed upon detection of the `-align`
switch in the command line. For each gene, alignment parameters can be
set using `--V`,`--D` or `--J`. *Specifying any of those three argument
will cause to align only the specified genes*. In order to specify a set
of parameters for all genes or force to align all genes the argument
`--all` should be passed. The arguments for setting the different
parameters are given in the table below.
If the considered sequences are nucleotide CDR3 sequences (delimited by 
its anchors on 3' and 5' sides) using the command `--ntCDR3` alignments will
be performed using gene anchors information as offset bounds.

|Command line argument |Description
|`---thresh X` |Sets the score threshold for the considered gene
alignments to _X_. Default is 50.0 for V, 15.0 for D and 15.0 for J

|`---matrix path/to/file` |Sets the substitution matrix to the one given
in the file. Must be _','_ delimited. Default is a NUC44 matrix with
stronger penalty on errors (5,-14)

|`---gap_penalty X` |Sets the alignment gap penalty to X. Default is
50.0

|`---best_only` |If _true_ only keep the best alignment per gene/allele.
If _false_ outputs all alignments above the score threshold. Default is
_true_ for V and J, and _false_ for D.

|`---offset_bounds M N` |Constrains the possible positions of the
alignments. The offset is defined as the position on the read to which
the first nucleotide of the genomic template aligns (can be negative,
e.g for V for which most of the V is on the 5' of the read and cannot be
seen)
